# BAKA
### booking and kindling archiver

BAKA is a simple command line tool that allows users to download manga from the internet and
converts it into azw3 formatted ebooks for use with kindle devices. It uses
BeautifulSoup 4 to parse hosting sites for images, and currently relies on the ebook converter included in [Calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) by [Kovid Goyal](https://kovidgoyal.net) for the conversion. 

In chapter mode images are compiled and converted into a single ebook, but more powerful functionality is
found in collection mode. This mode collects multiple chapters into a single file and separates the individual chapters with a table of contents. 
In both modes, BAKA cleans up after itself, leaving behind only a ready to read ebook.
 
Baka is my first personal project, so I plan to update it as I grow as a developer. As of now, it's usable if you know how to run python scripts but eventually there will be an installable binary(.exe).

## Usage:
To use BAKA just clone this repo, navigate to the baka folder, use pip to install the requirements.txt file, and in the src folder either 
1. run main.py from your ide
2. add the baka folder to your PYTHONPATH and run it from a terminal 

‚ùóNote that at the moment, BAKA relies on Calibre being installed in its default location and works on Mac OSX and Windows 10

### Dev roadmap:
  - faster parsing
  - larger library with backup sources
  - concurrent file/chapter downloading
  - book batch mode (download several collections of a certain size)
  - make it pretty with blessing
  - write independent conversion tool in either go or rust

##### Wishful thinking:
  - a user mode where users can locate good manga sources and save their own profiles for manga not built in
